# my-first-java-class66
A program is required to model the concept of a person. A person has a name, last name, ID number, and year of birth. The class should have a constructor that initializes the values of its respective attributes.

The class should include the following methods:

Define a method to print the attribute values of the object to the console.
Add two new attributes to the Person class:
An attribute representing the person’s country of birth (type String)
An attribute identifying the person’s gender, represented as a char with values 'M' (male), 'F' (female), or 'O' (other).
Modify the constructor of the Person class to initialize these two new attributes.
Modify the print method in the Person class to display the values of the new attributes.
Start the console application from the App class. In the main method of the App class, create two Person objects and display their attribute values on the screen (Terminal).

Note: Use System.out.println() to print to the console.

Requirements
Meet the specifications described above.
The attributes of the Person class must be tested (test coverage of at least 70%).
Code must be written in English.
